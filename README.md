# Empires Of Catan

A program for editing, localizing and printing cards for the game Empires of Catan.

Empires of Catan is a very cool extension for the board game Catan, developed by redditor Dj-oatmeal. The extension tries to use the ideas of Age of Empires when playing Catan. More information about Empires of Catan can be found on the following pages:

To add a new language, create a new subdirectory in the Localizations directory. Then, when you launch the program, you can select a new language and create and print cards in your language.
